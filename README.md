# MagnetoSuture Annotator
This annotator was built for the specific purpose of annotating videos for the MiniMagnetoSuture project under Dr. Yancy Diaz-Mercado and Suraj Raval in the UMD Department of Mechanical Engineering. 

Videos must be in .mp4 format under an h.264 encoding. `ffmpeg` can be used to achieve this conversion.
```
 ffmpeg -i input.avi -vcodec libx264 output.mp4
 ```
